//! Unsafe Declarations for the illumos STREAMS API
//!
//! This module merely re-exports the subset of the illumos STREAMS api that we need for this
//! project. It makes no attempt at safety or ergonomics.
//!
//! While STREAMS are not strictly relevant to this project, some of their features are overloaded
//! to work with doors. Those are the bits we redefine here.

extern "C" {
    /// Makes a door descriptor visible on the filesystem.
    ///
    /// Just like sockets must be created (as descriptors) and *then* attached to an IP Address +
    /// Port Number by calling [`BIND(3SOCKET)`], doors are created (as descriptors) and *then*
    /// attached to a path on the filesystem by calling [`FATTACH(3C)`].
    ///
    /// [`BIND(3SOCKET)`]: https://illumos.org/man/3socket/bind
    /// [`FATTACH(3C)`]: https://illumos.org/man/3c/fattach
    pub fn fattach(fildes: libc::c_int, path: *const libc::c_char) -> libc::c_int;

    /// Withdraw a door descriptor from the filesystem.
    ///
    /// After the door is detached from the filesystem, no new processes will be able to acquire
    /// a descriptor by means of [`OPEN(2)`]. Processes which already have access to the door will
    /// still be able to invoke it via [`DOOR_CALL(3C)`], and even forward the descriptor to other
    /// processes via other socket or door connections. So, we can say this call stops new clients
    /// from connecting to a door server unless an existing client shares its descriptor.
    ///
    /// [`DOOR_CALL(3C)`]: https://illumos.org/man/3c/door_call
    /// [`OPEN(2)`]: https://illumos.org/man/2/open

    // See /src/illumos/mod.rs for tests. The doors_h and stropts_h modules rely on each other for
    // complete functionality, so it's easier to test them together. The only reason they are
    // defined separately is to mimic how they are defined in illumos' libc headers.
