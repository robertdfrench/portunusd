//! illumos-specific APIs not (yet) found in the libc crate
//!
//! Portunus makes heavy use of illumos' [doors] facility, a novel IPC system that resembles UNIX
//! domain sockets but allows for *much* faster switching between client and server contexts.
//! Because of its obscurity and sharp corners, there is not yet a full representation of the doors
//! API in the [libc] crate.
//!
//! In this module, we represent only the subset of the illumos-specific APIs that we need for
//! Portunus.
